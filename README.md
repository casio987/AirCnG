# AirCnG
## Overview
Often, when wanting to go camping at locations far from home, the main mode of transport would be through an airline. However, this comes with many restrictions on what you can bring. For example an airline may not allow you to bring your folding saw, flint, knife, etc.

AirCnG helps to solve this issue by allowing users to both post their camping gear up for rent and rent camping gear that's *is* up for rent.

It's like Airbnb but for camping gear!
